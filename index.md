Modern Day Game or the Most Deadly Game you decide. A modern day adventure
game

Copyright 2002 Game Design: Eli Sacks, Mark Essel, Aakin Patel

#   Introduction

After chasing the suspect down a series of small alleyways he seemingly
vanishes into mist before your very eyes. Any dreams of your private agency
taking a few pictures of a lecherous husband or finding a lost dog for a
couple of extra bucks was just shot to hell along with your partner. You hear
sounds of scuffling boots going up the fire escape on an adjacent building,
now's not the time to ponder. Reflexes take over and your .38 special is
brought to bear on the bastard as a disturbing voice echoes from the shadows,
“Mr. Slate I've brought you here for one reason, don't worry about your co-
worker he was part of the set up and is in excellent health. I couldn't
publicly approach you. You see, they are always watching. You have a very
unique talent to ferret out secrets and I need that ability to help me find my
daughter. Selena's been missing for three years now and I believe a government
agency has taken her hostage for experiments. You're the only one who can find
her, here's fifty thousand incentives to get your started…”

It's been a few weeks and you've narrowed down the whereabouts of Cynthia to a
tomb beneath an ancient Mayan pyramid where the cult she joined (and was later
abducted by) now resides. It's a race against time, as you make your way down
hall after stone hall, knocking out any cultist guards silently as you go. As
you creep up from the shadows you overlook a horrifying sight. You can see Mr.
Black's daughter's lifeless form twitching as her assassins exalt over her
headless form. A rush of anger washes over you, to be replaced by cold and
calculating righteous vengeance. You dive into the room with both 9mm's firing
taking out cultist after cultist as you make your way to the man holding the
blade. He motions his guardians to the side as he leans forwards, begins
violently coughing and his visage transforms in a moment from euphoria to
hellspawn. Fangs protrude from his mouth and his eyes go the color of dusk.
What have you got yourself into now? Your last memories are of the hammering
of your gun chambers as you take down one more cultist before the vampire
fists struck you multiple times in the face.

Pain…

Death…

Thirst…

Your sire's name is Solomon, and he's lead this cult of followers to provide
sustenance to him for over a hundred years. He's revered as an immortal god.
His decision to turn you was motivated by a need for additional knowledge
about Mr. Black, and you're simply a tool. That's fine, you've considered
yourself worth even less when you breathed, and it's better than being dead.
You make your way out of the jungle with a new mission, a new benefactor, and
a recently obtained allergy to sunlight.

In this version of the Victus Role Playing System, you play the part of
investigators from a modern day Earthlike setting.

#   Character Generation

##   Quick Character Creation

###   Attributes

Every character has 6 main attributes:

  * Strength (STR) \- The ability to push, pull, slice, dice, chop, and carry.

##   Attributes Details

Characters have 6 basic attributes in the Victus game system: Strength,
Agility, Durability, Thought, Will, and Presence. An average human has a score
of 4 in every attribute. The maximum a normal person can have in an attribute
is 10, although realistically, 99% of the population never reaches above a 8.
Gifted individuals can exceed these values.

There are two ways to generate attributes. Unless the GM decides otherwise,
the PC may choose the method of attribute generation.

Method 1: Starting Investigators have 42 points to distribute among their
stats, with a minimum of 1 in any stat, and a maximum of 10.

Method 2: Roll 2d6 for each attribute placed to taste (rolls of 11, 12 are
lowered to a 10). Also add +6 floating points as desired (up to the starting
maximum of 10). You may make one complete set of rerolls (including the
floating points) but must keep the new rolls.

Attributes can be advanced during the course of the game, using XP points.
(See Experience Points section at the end of this chapter).

####   Basic Attributes

Strength (STR): The physical ability to push, pull, slice, dice, chop, and
carry. Strength determines the base amount of damage done with a punch, or
adds to the damage done with a hand held melee weapon. Maximum lifting
capacity (equivalent to lifting over their head) is 2(Strength/2)*20. Standing
jumps can be up to a characters strength/2 in feet. Horizontal distance may be
up to the characters strength in feet. A running jump doubles these heights
and distances.

This score is used in conjunction with skills to strike at an opponent or to
dodge out of the way of their blows. Agility is also the base jogging movement
of an individual in yards per round (so a normal human can jog 4 yards per
second, or a little over 8.4 miles per hour). Humans may walk at half this
rate (on average 2 yards per second or 4.2 miles per hour) and sprint at 1.5
times the jogging rate (13 miles per hour). Sprinting can only be done for
5xDurability in Seconds, jogging can be done for 5Xdurability in minutes
(although the running skill can extend this time). The scale factor from
yards/sec to miles per hour is 2.1 (6 yards/sec is about 12.6 miles per hour).
Also Agility is used to determine the number of actions a character may take
in a round. The number of actions a character may take per round is equal to
their Agility/4 rounding down.

Durability (DUR): A characters overall toughness and endurance, and lets you
survive not managing to avoid someone with a lot of strength.This stat is used
to determine a characters resistance to damage. The number of Hit points a
character begins with is equal to their durability. (The Grit sub-power can
increase hit points over this amount). Also, for every three points of
Durability (rounded down), the character gains a point of DR (0 skin DR for
DUR 1 to 2, +1 skin DR for DUR 3 to 5, +2 skin DR for DUR 6 to 8, etc). This
is cumulative with other armors.

Thought (THT): Intelligence, learning ability, analytical skills, speed of
thought, ability to react well to new situations. Memory is also represented
by this attribute, but only to a lesser extent. Thought is the attribute
associated with most skills, and also determines the starting number of skill
points (THT x 2) (Example: THT 4 gives you 8 starting skill points). It is
also used for base initiative (THT + + d20, tie's are decided by THT if still
tied they roll off d20 to determine who goes before the other).

Will (WIL): Willpower. Resisting mental attacks, performing well under
pressure. This stat is also necessary for difficult or drawn out tasks, and
also represents the character's perception and attention to detail.

Presence (PRS): Deals with all social situations. A high presence allows a
character to influence others around him/her. For social interactions, roll a
d20 + PRS + SKL vs. target # ( WIL + SKL + 11) (Where SKL represents the
appropriate social skill). Additional situational modifiers [neutral 0, target
angered +4 difficulty, target happy -4 difficulty, +skill bonus if
applicable]) may apply; these are up to the GM. There are times when this
attribute is inapplicable (when arguing with your mother, or in most action
sequences for instance, although intimidation or a demand to surrender may be
possible when used in unison with an impressive act).

##   Gifts Details

Starting characters get 10 Gift Points. An additional 10 Gift Points may be
gained by taking a disadvantage. Temporary Will Points may be gained for
certain Gifts, each Gift has it's own pool of temporary Will points that it
draws from. So with a Will of 6 you may use Fujisawa 3 times per day (6
temporary will points) and Evil Eye 6 times. The Cost of each Gift in Points
is in parenthesis () next to the name of the gift.

  * Aquatic Affinity(3): This sub-power yields +4 bonus levels (these levels ride on top of the purchased levels) to the swimming skill, the ability to breathe underwater and innate friendliness with undersea life. You receive no penalties when in a liquid environment (normally underwater gives -4 to hit and base damage).
  * The Chef(5): You were trained at the HL Culinary Institute and Martial Arts School. Get +2 bonus level to melee, acrobatics and the cooking skill (these levels ride on top of the purchased levels).
  * Contingency Man(5): Player gets to have whatever random items they want (up to 5 items a week worth $500 each, or 1 item worth $2500). Beginning characters start off with up to $10,000 worth of items. This sub-power can defy the laws of physics and is explained by a supernatural ability to subconsciously create needed items or by an excellently prepared investigator.
  * Educated(3): Character starts off with +8 extra starting skills. If they wish, they can have a formal education in their background, or be well trained (elite soldiers, master diplomat, etc). Also, beginning characters can raise one starting skill to level 8.
  * Everyday is your Birthday(5): An enviable gift that makes every day your character’s birthday. Presents randomly show up each day(anywhere in value from $100 - $1000) but they’re not necessarily useful, hot chicks that sing a short birthday song and mysteriously vanish. Your character gains +2 Presence (everyone is more willing to let things slide because it’s your birthday). Additionally your character gains 2 agility as he perceives and reacts much quicker than any normal human. There is a down side. Your character begins the game at age 20 and will die in 60 days. If you are able to find a cure all bonuses gained from the gift are lost (but you may choose to gain a new gift to replace this one) but your age remains, hahaha OLD MAN!.
  * Evil Eye(5): Presence+d20 vs. Will+11 to make target surrender and lay prone often times release their bowels for (1+number of successes) actions. In addition can be used as a direct physical missile assault, with base damage equal to Presence+6. It costs one temporary will point per usage.
  * Famous(3): Like a movie star or hero. People know you, makes it easier to get things done or buy things cheap. You always can get into exclusive clubs or even get out of tickets or everyday hastles. The downside is that sometimes you attract more attention than you'd like.
  * Fujisawa(7): Addicted to smoking & drinking. Get +2 to str, agility (can go above your normal maximum) if you quit smoking or drinking for 10 minutes, which costs 2 temporary will points and takes affect immediately. You may smoke an entire cigarette in one inhaling. The cost is 6 temporary will points to refrain from both substances simultaneously for 10 minutes. Gain +4 str, agility (can go above your normal maximum), note that at least a 6 will is required to stop using both substances and in this case (6 will) the character would require a day of normal addiction before consciously refraining from either substance again. If the character is forceably removed from one or both substances the appropriate level of power will manifest (either +2 or +4 to STR & AGI) and during this time the character will complain about missing one or both of the addicted substances and actively seek them at the soonest possible opportunity. The game master may allow you to substitute other addictions instead of drinking or smoking. Fujisawa is mutually exclusive with Vampire and Lycanthrope (only one of these three may be chosen).
  * Grit(7): (Durability) this grants a character the Grit Power (raised with xp as a power 2 * next level in xp to raise). This power is vital for any investigator who wishes to engage in dangerous activities such as melee combat, absorbing bullets to the face, or leaping off of tall cliffs. This power gives a character Durability*Grit level in extra hit points ( i.e. a character with level 1 grit has double his durability in HP).
  * Level 5: Not Dead Yet: Characters strong in Grit become ridiculously tough, refusing to feel wounds that would drop other people. Characters with this specialty do not pass into unconsciousness when going below 0 hit points; they may stand and fight until they die. Also, they gain the unique ability to strangle opponents with their own dangling innards. NOTE: You have a skill penalty equivalent to your negative hit points.
  * Hat Handed(5): An additional 1 action per round is gained with the hat hand ( small hand can use only small weapons - knives, derringers or other small pistols, the strength of the hand is your normal strength - 4, minimum of 1 ). The hand is sensitive to daylight→ should be covered by a hat or turban (if exposed to daylight the damage caused is 1 hit point/hour. If the hat hand suffers 8 or more hit points from this effect the hat handed is maimed and requires special healing (either medical hospital or psychic healing) before it may be used again. Two bonus skill levels are given to the following scientific skills: Genetics, Research, and Computer Systems.
  * Hero(3): Your character is a local hero wherever he travels and is well loved respected by all he or she sees. Much like the lawful side of underground connections, you can call in a automatic favor once per game of the local authorities or government.
  * Immunity to Poison and Disease(3): You are immune to poisons and diseases of all sorts.
  * Innate Pilot(3): You are a master of piloting all forms of vehicular transports. Innate Pilots get a +4 bonus skill levels to all pilot-related skills. This bonus rides on top of the normal skill level. This means that an innate pilot is NEVER unskilled at piloting, even if he doesnt buy the appropriate skill.
  * License to Kill(3): You are part of an organization that allows you to kill for their purposes. This can be revoked by the organization. This organization has great pull with local authorities or may be the local authority.
  * Lycanthrope(10): You have a darker creature side. On each full moon you automatically transform into a hybrid humanoid form of whatever creature you choose for this Gift. At other times when you are damaged and fail a difficulty 20 will check you reflexively shapeshift. You may willingly shapeshift at any time into the hybrid form or the full creature form. Gain +2 to one attribute (and it’s maximum) of your choice. Additionaly in hybrid or creature form gain an ability related to the creature you choose, Dragons/Owls would gain flight at double base movement speed, Cheetahs may gain a land based speed boost that allows them to double their sprinting speed, +2 Alertness Skill would also be an acceptable ability to choose. You regenerate one hit point of damage per round (unless silver damage) and cannot normally be killed unless by silver (damage exceeding 3 times their negative durability will also kill them). Unfortunately silver weapons inflict double damage to you (when damage is calculated double any damage that would normally get past damage resistance). When in creature or hybrid form you character gains instinctual personality traits, perhaps hunting for food if hungry, etc. Lycanthrope is mutually exclusive with Fujisawa and Vampire (only one of these three may be chosen).
  * The Mojo(4): These characters tend to be well spoken or attractive or both. Characters get +4 Presence vs people of the opposite sex of the character.
  * Mystic(10): This grants a character the Occult Lore skill (raised with xp as a power 2 * next level in xp to raise). Not only have you have been born with or granted by mystical forces and intuitive understanding of the supernatural but your study of ancient texts and mysterious knowledge is unmatched. You have a number of power points equal to your Thought attribute + the sum of all your Occult Lore Skill Levels. For a level 3 Occultist with a THT of 7 your total power points is 13= 7 + 1 + 2 + 3.
  * Ninja(5): A master of stealth, acrobatics and scaling sheer surfaces. This character is talented at Stealth, Acrobatics and Climbing, adding +2 bonus skill levels to these skills.
  * Photographic memory(3): You dont EVER forget anything.
  * Psychic Healer(5): Can heal d6+1 hit points per temporary will point. 5 temporary will points for curing disease, blindness, and/or limb regeneration. If characters in the group have disadvantages like, blind or appendage impaired you may restrict the effect of the healing to certain, extraordinarily rare circumstances (motivate them to quest to cure their ailment or live with it) in their cases because of the level of bodily damage (like an eclipse under a rainbow when the stars glow bright green).
  * Sharpened senses(5): You are constantly aware of your surroundings. Get +2 bonus levels added to the alertness skill (rides on top of the purchased skill level and gain masteries sooner). Your sharpened vision grants +2 bonus level to the missile skill (rides on top of base skill). A major aspect of stealth is being where your opponents aren’t observing, gain +2 bonus to stealth skill.
  * Supernatural Background(7): You have something in your origin that marks you as supernatural. Either genetic enhancement or perhaps mutation, or something altogether different like insane natural exercise to the point of being impossible. Add +2 to a stat and its maximum. This Gift may only be taken once per attribute.
  * Sustained(4): You dont need to drink, eat, or sleep and produce no bodily waste when refraining from drinking or eating.
  * Telepath(5): You are sensitive to the minds of others. Once per day per will point, you get to make an opposed will check of d20+Will versus Targets Will +11 to successfully pick up information they may be concealing or their surface thoughts. For every success the character makes, additional knowledge may be gained. Gain +2 bonus skill levels to Bargaining checks (gain masteries sooner).
  * Thick Skinned(7): You were abused by pygmy alligators as a child, and as a result, get +2 to DR. This is cumulative with DR gained from natural durability, armor and or spells.
  * Tinkerer(5): You are a master of building and creating machines. Tinkerers get a +2 bonus skill levels to the Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Power Systems. This bonus rides on top of the normal skill level.
  * Underground Connection(2): This is a presence based Gift but due to some family or old buddies you have connections in all sorts of underground or criminal circles. From gambling to illegal goods to illegal death matches you are on the inside loop. Automatically once per game know somebody in a related area and can call in a favor.
  * Vampire(10): Gain +2 to two attributes (and their maximums) of your choice (not the same one), but sunlight now causes your harm. For each round you stand in direct sunlight (without some type of protection or covering) you take 1d6 burn damage to your hitpoints which you cannot heal until nightfall. In addition you may heal d6 points of damage to yourself once per day per will point. Only sunlight or beheading while staked will kill a vampire otherwise at normal death the vampire is forced into gaseous form and reforms at the next dusk. Finally the vampire may only sustain himself on blood, and must drink at least 20 pints per week (even a sustained vampire). When a vampire drinks blood (from any creature type) they heal one point per pint they consume. Vampire is mutually exclusive with Fujisawa and Lycanthrope (only one of these three may be chosen).
  * Warlord(5): You are a master of combat and strategy. Warlords get +2 bonus skill levels to the Melee, Missile and Tactics skill. This bonus rides on top of the normal skill level. This means that a warlord is NEVER unskilled at physical combat, even if he doesnt buy the appropriate skill.
  * Minor Wealth(3): Simple stated, you are filthy rich. Start off with 1d6 * $1,000,000
  * Wealth(7): Simple stated, you are filthy rich. Start off with 1d6 * $1,000,000,000

##   Flaw Details

Characters may choose one disadvantage to flush out their character's
background. This Disadvantage allows the choice of another Gift.

  * Addicted / Obsessed / OCD(10): You are compelled to behave in a manner detrimental to you, or are obessed with having something or partaking in something that is definitely bad for you, and significantly impacts your ability to perform as a part of the team.
  * Appendage Impaired(10): your character has been maimed in some way or lost the use of at least one of his or her appendages, 1 arm or 1 leg).
  * Blind(10): your character cannot see and may not make normal ranged attacks (use of other gifts like the evil eye is still allowed, perhaps a rotting and scarred eyesocket projects the malevolence) unless an alertness check is made (difficulty dependant on range/noise of target).
  * Control Freak(5): You incur significant penalties when you are not in charge of the situation (penalties to skill and presence checks). You have a hard time taking orders from others.
  * Clueless(10): your character is always last to get a joke and is pretty oblivious/living in his own world. During any conflict or action sequence your character initiative is always last. This can be very bad if an explosive is thrown in the area. “What a bomb, oh…”. “KABOOM!”.
  * Hallucinations: Your senses are completely unreliable, in an inconsistant manner. You often see or hear things that aren't there, or are completely different from what is actually there, and don't realize it. (GM decides when this comes into play).
  * Hillbilly(10): Lose 8 starting skill levels. If this puts you into negatives, the negative skill levels must be bought off at 1xp per point before new skills can be purchased.
  * Inbred(10): Gives you -2 to an attribute and it's maximum value (now a 8). And yes, you have to be inbred.
  * Infamous(5): You are a nefarious outlaw, known to all for your depraved acts of villainy. If people recognize you, they attempt to shoot or capture you on sight or perhaps just throw rotten vegetables. Bounty hunters will relentlessly track you down along with local police and swat teams usually at inconvenient moments. This is usually a major inconvenience, and players often find ways of escaping from prison/sentencing etc.
  * Mutant Mark(10): You have a visible trait that is abnormal, hard to hide, somewhat of a hinderance, and extremely distinctive. You may have purple skin, be a cyclops, have a conjoined twin, an extra non-functional hand on the top of your head, continously bleed from all your orifices, etc.
  * Over the Edge(5): You will always take the riskier path. Whenever there is a choice to do something dangerous, you will. Self preservation is not a part of your plan. Spectacular explosions are.
  * Paranoid(5): You never feel safe. You may do things like stay up all night standing guard when in a hostile area, leaving yourself exhausted, even though your teammates were taking a watch shift as well. It's not that you don't trust your teammates, but you never know what could happen…
  * Useless dependant(5): Once per game, you have to deal with an useless dependant getting into some sort of trouble or needing your help, usually at an extremely unopportune moment.

##   Skills Details

In addition to Attributes, characters have skills to round out their
abilities. Starting characters get 2*THT in skill points to assist in
character generation. Each skill point can be used to buy 1 level in a skill.
Starting characters can buy a skill up to a maximum of skill level 6.

Advancing a skill after the game starts is more expensive than buying it up
with the starting skill points. A standard gaming session should yield between
8+ XP depending on what the gm feels your characters accomplished. Using XP
points to raise a skill works in the following way:

  * To learn a new skill it costs 1 xp (normal skills).
  * To advance (specialize) a skill, it costs the next level in XP.(i.e. to raise a skill to level 2, it costs 2 points. To raise it from 2 to 3, it costs 3 points).
  * Skill levels are NOT limited (no upper bound)

Many powes and sub-powers provide bonus levels to skills. These levels ride on
top of any purchased levels and are cumulative (use the lower base value to
determine the cost to raise the skill directly).

Each level must be paid for. (You can not raise a skill from a 2 to a 4
without first paying for 3). XP may be used to purchase skills at any time.

Skill Mastery: Once level 10 is reached in a skill, your character gains a
mastery ability. An additional mastery is gained every four levels after 10
(14, 18, etc.) if available. This is an ability that you pick (one out of the
list available for any given skill) that helps show that you are truly a
legendary master at that skill. (For example, melee masters can learn thrown
melee weapons, quickdraw, etc). Mastery abilities are listed under each skill
in italics.

But if you are good at it, you are invincible (at least for a limited time). Or it seems that way, at least. In addition if your character hasnt yet made the check that day upon being knocked unconscious (or killed outright) you can make a roll to activate the ability as you are being injured to stay conscious (and alive) for at least skill level in rounds.
  * Bargaining: (Presence) Attempt to lower price. Each roll Haggling check. Whoever wins add, or subtracts 10% per victory point to/from start price. The range limit is half the listed price to double the listed price.

  * Computer Systems: (Thought) The ability to use computer systems (including globals), write useful programs, and hack into computer systems. Computer programs require 1 day per skill point, and the program writer must have the appropriate skill at one level higher. So in order to write a level 5 Melee skill program the computer systems writer must have 6 levels in the Melee skill. In order to learn this skill AIs or newly created life forms should have access to neural jacks and are required to have available skills ranks.

You can not defend against attacks that have a base damage of 5 or more than that of the weapon used for point defense.
  * Ambidexterity: Allows a character to fight using a weapon in each hand (melee and/or missile), gaining an extra attack per round. This extra attack is at a 2 penalty to hit.

  * Research: (Thought) Useful for inventing new technologies or learning ways to do things that you know can be done, but are not sure how. A roll is made to successfully design a new item. The difficulty needs to be determined by the game master. Most technologies have been maximized but certain upgrades are available, for instance vehicle agility can be increased for star ships (up to 2 times the base), and masterly crafted weapons can be made +2 to hit→ thats pretty much it). New items can be made with existing technology though (for combination items take the highest difficulty and add 2 for each other item involved, add all times. etc.) Research difficulty is the item construction difficulty +2. Research time is double the normal creation time of any involved equipment (NO speed up for the matter creation power). For each success or 2 points over the target research roll research time is reduced by 1 week (minimum 1week).
  * Sponsered: The character has become a master at finding money from various grants, and has gained an incredible amount of flexible funding as a result. The character has at their disposal, $100,000*(ResearchSkill - 9) in American dollars per month as a research budget.

If two tactitions are battling against each other a contest of skills rolls is made Thought +Tactics + d20 vs OpponentsThought + OpponentsTactics + d20.
  * Aura of Command: The strategic master now adds +6 to hit and to the initiative of all allied combatants and is always successful (2 opposing master tacticians give both of their troops +6 to hit and initiative). Also, they may engage in a land war in Asia and win.
  * Legendary General: The leadership of this tactics master is legendary! Enemies quake in fear of their involvement. Troops from opposing forces abandon their posts. Also any organized force that is known to have this tactics master as one of it's generals, gains additional volunteers who flock to their cause. The percentage of troops that abandon the enemy and rally to the tactic's master is X%.
  * Weapon Systems: (Agility) Characters with this skill are able to successfully use ship-based weapons.
  * Quick Shot: +1 to Initiative for each weapon systems level (cumulative with other initiative boosters, missile and melee mastery (quickshot and quickdraw respectively).

This does take up ammunition though (for ships dont worry about this unless using cronium weapons) You can not defend against attacks that have a base damage of 5 or higher than that of the base damage of the weapon used for point defense (MARK NEED TO UPDATE THIS EXAMPLE) (so a mag heavy rifle, damage 7 could stop a heavy laser rifle, damage 9, but not a plasma cannon damage 12 or greater).
  * Wood Working: (Agility) Make figures, toys, wooden weapons. Can make a living as a carpenter.
  * Carver: Can craft masterpiece wooden items like the slave elves for Santa, complete with decorative carvings. ( i.e. masterwork quarterstaffs, elaborate furniture, etc).

#   Game Rules

##   Basics of The Victus Gaming System

###   Experience Points

A standard gaming session should yield between 8-12 XP depending on what the
gm feels your characters accomplished.

####   Spending XP

Using XP points to raise a skill works in the following way: * To learn a new
skill it costs 1 xp (normal skills). * To advance (specialize) a skill, it
costs the next level in XP.(i.e. to raise a skill to level 2, it costs 2
points. To raise it from 2 to 3, it costs 3 points). * Skill levels are NOT
limited and may be raised to any level. * Many powes and gifts provide bonus
levels to skills. These levels ride on top of any purchased levels (use the
lower base value to determine the cost to raise the skill directly). * Each
level must be paid for. (You can not raise a skill from a 2 to a 4 without
first paying for 3). XP may be used to purchase skills at any time.

###   Attributes, Gifts, and Skills

Attributes: Basic inherent character abilities.

Gifts: Sometimes supernatural, sometimes incredible natural talents, these
abilities help customize a character's powers

Flaws: These represent significant disadvantages your investigator may have,
and help add flavor to a character

Skills: Learned abilities.

####   How to Make Power Checks

Power + d20 vs. ATT + SKILL + 11

####   How to Make Skill Checks

Having a skill at Level 1 means that you are a novice in that skill. (In the
case of trade skills, such as smithing, this means that you can hold down a
very basic job performing that action). Skill level 4-6 means that you are a
skilled professional. Skill levels 7-9 are experts and skill levels 10+ are
masters of their trade.

In game terms, this means that you get a +1 to a roll for every level you have
in a skill. (In other words, your bonus is equal to your skill leve). Example:
Say your character has the smithing skill at level 3. This means that you have
a +3 bonus to every smithing roll you make. All skills are associated with an
attribute to determine a roll. This attribute is not always fixed; different
situations call for different attributes. The GM will decide what is
appropriate in a given situation. Example: Stealth can be used to sneak around
and is paired with AGI.

Rolls are made in the following manner:

d20+ATT+SKL

where ATT is the appropriate attribute (STR, AGI, DUR, THT, WIL, PRS) and
skill is the level of skill being used. Resistance values are static and are
ATT+SKL+11. Note that in the case noticing a sneaking character, the observer
may roll a d20 + Alertness Skill Levels + WIL versus a static stealth number
of AGI + Stealth Skill Levels + 11.

Advancing a skill after the game starts is more expensive than buying it up
with the starting skill points. Using XP points to raise a skill works in the
following way:

  * To learn a new skill it costs 1 xp (normal skills).
  * To advance (specialize) a skill, it costs the next level in XP.(i.e. to raise a skill to level 2, it costs 2 points. To raise it from 2 to 3, it costs 3 points).
  * Each level must be paid for. (You can not raise a skill from a 2 to a 4 without first paying for 3).

Skill checks are made using the appropriate stat, as described above.
Unskilled attempts have a penalty of 2 to the roll, and may sometimes not be
available(NU is used to denote skills that may not be rolled for unskilled,
NU=not unskilled). When a check is required the target rolls d20. A roll of a
1 is an automatic failure unless the character is a master of the skill (level
10+). A roll of 20 is an automatic success except in the case of a crack trip
difficulty.

For example, Bob Rica wants to leap off a moving bus traveling at 30 mph and
grab onto a car roof during an ice storm, open the passenger door and sit down
before his hair gets too wet. This is damn near impossible. So Bob takes his
agility 5 and because he's skilled level 2 in acrobatics his total bonus is 5
+ 2 = 7. To succeed Bob has to roll a 20 (that maneuver sounds like its damn
near impossible, game master determines difficulties) or higher to make the
target number of 30 (20 always succeeds unless the action is Crack-Trip. Bob
decides this is just too tough, so instead he decides to just leap on top of
the car (that's still average target number of 18) so the roll necessary is now an
11 (5 + 2 + d20 target number 18) or better. Suppose Bob was level 4 in
acrobatics, this has a strong effect on his odds of making the leap now the
total is 5 agility + 4 skill + d20 so he'd only need to roll a 9 to make it.
If Bob werent skilled in acrobatics at all he'd need to roll a 15 (5 agility -
2 unskilled penalty + d20 target # 18).

Target #'s requiring a roll of higher than 20 are possible. As an example,
suppose Bob Rica wanted to pull off his belt, swing it around the back of the
car, and water ski on the icy road behind the car after leaping from the bus.
The difficulty level would be Crack-Trip (34) so in order to even attempt it,
Bob would have to have skill level 10 in one of the appropriate skills. In
addition if Bob weren't skilled in both rope use and acrobatics (close to
skiing) hed incur an additional 2 penalty.

Let's say Bob doesn't have rope use, but has acrobatica (a good catch all
fancy maneuver skill) and with his 5 agility and 10 skill he'd need a roll of
20 (5 + 10 + d20 - 2 unskilled, target # 34), which is a 21 or better on a d20
roll which is impossible, but remember a roll of 20 allows an additional d20
roll, which is added to the original (this extra die roll can be earned only
once). Very powerful investigators can do this sort of thing routinely due to
expert training and adventuring.

##   Combat

Combat is fast and vicious in the Victus Game system. Rounds are 1 second
long, which means that most battles are over in 3 to 5 seconds; it doesnt take
that long to have a sword thrust through you.

An action is either a movement or attack (so if you want to move and attack it
requires 2 actions).

Characters can use all of their actions in a round. The number of actions that
a character can take is determined by the characters AGI, dividing it by 4,
and rounding down. A character takes all of his actions on his initiative,
which is determined by rolling a d20 and adding it to a characters THT.
Alternatively they may hold one action as an interrupt triggered by another
event, “I blaze away with my harpoon gun at the first target through the
door”. Or they may delay all their actions until after an event happens, “I
delay my initiative until the first guy comes into the room”.

###   Attacking

An attack succeeds if the attackers HIT value is equal to or greater than the
opposing characters TARGET value (which can be determined by their EVADE or
PARRY value, depending on what they choose to do). The HIT value is determined
by:

Agi + SKL + d20

SKL refers to the Skill level (usually melee or missile, in the case of
combat). If the character doesnt have an appropriate skill, then they have a
penalty of 2 to the roll (giving them Agi + d20 - 2). If a character isnt
caught unawares, and tries to dodge the enemys attack, their EVADE value is
what determines the target difficulty number for the attack. The EVADE value
of the target is determined by the following:

Agi + SKL + 11

In this particular case, the SKL level used would be based on the Acrobatica
skill. If the character is trying to parry (which can only be done against a
melee attack), the skill is Melee. Finally shields (like a buckler), some
items, and skill masteries add a Deflection bonus that is added to both parry
and evade (defends against both melee and missile).

For vehicle combat the attack SKL is usually Weapon Systems for larger
weapons, small (Heavy Rifles or lighter) turret mounted weapons may be fired
using Missile skill. The defense SKL is the appropriate piloting skill. Note
that the attack totals (Agi + SKL = HIT) and the defense bonus (Agi + SKL) are
limited by the vehicle agility. The max evade is equal to 11 + vehicle agility
(certain masteries can go beyond this limit). So for a vehicle with an 8
vehicle agility, the best evade possible is an 11 + 8 = 19, and the best
attack bonus with any hull mounted weapons on this vehicle is +8. Turret
mounted weapon systems are only limited by the skill and agility of the
gunnery but take up double the space. Note that the upper limit on vehicle
agility is around 28. Take a (10 base + 4 mastery) x 2 = 28. Characters with
skills and abilities that surpass these levels find themselves hampered by
technology.

If the target is surprised, then the TARGET number is the default base of 11.
Remember a roll of a 1 is an automatic miss/failure. Only one surprise attack
is made (not all of the characters actions), then initiative and normal combat
rules/evades apply. If the HIT number is greater than or equal to the TARGET
number, a hit is scored. If the HIT number exceeds the TARGET number by two or
more, a SUCCESS is gained for every 2 points (rounded down) the TARGET number
is exceeded by. Damage from a successful attack is determined by the
following:

Base Damage + # Successes DRtarget

The Base Damage for melee or thrown weapons is Strattacker + weapon bonus. The
Base Damage for other weapons is listed in the weapons table in the equipment
section. The maximum damage any attack may do is the base times two. For
example a powerful human with Str = 5 wielding a Two-Handed plasma sword
(Str+8 damage) has a base damage of 13, and a maximum damage of 26. Damage can
be absorbed by DR (which stands for Damage Resistance). Every character gets a
base DR determined by their DUR/3 (rounded down). This is their bodies DR and
is applied to all physical attacks (note that mental attacks like influence
use the Will stat to determine DR much like Durability is used to calculate DR
for physical attacks). In addition to the bodies DR, characters may have
additional DR from armor or powers.

A critical hit is scored if the attacker rolls a 20. The attacker may roll
another d20 and add that to their to hit roll (there bye increasing their number of
successes and damage done, but they are still limited to 2XbaseDamage
maximum). This attack is considered an automatic hit and always causes at
least 1 point of damage per weapon past any DR the target has (although rapid
fire weapons can be fired full auto for d6 attacks in lieu of normal actions,
the minimum damage from a critical hit from such a burst is still only 1 point
NOT d6 points, although for a battery of 4 of such weaopns it'd be 4 points of
damage).

Underwater or foriegn environment gives attackers a -4 to hit roll, and -4 to
base damage.

###   DR Damage Resistance

Damage can be absorbed by DR (which stands for Damage Resistance). Characters
may have DR to two types of damage in MDG, Physical and Mental.

Almost all equipement give Armor or DR apply their DR to Physical attacks that
cause damage. Mental DR is usually WIL based.

Every character gets a base DR determined by their appropriate Attribute/3
(rounded down). This is their base DR and is applied to all attacks. Physical
attacks use Durability to calculate this base number, mental attacks use the
Will stat to determine DR. In addition to the base DR, characters may have
additional DR from other areas (skin, armor, field, etc.). Unless otherwise
noted, skin DR stacks, while armor and any other DR does not.

Drowning or suffocation damage is d6 per round bypassing all DR. Falling
damage is 1 point per 10ft fallen, maximized at 20 points for terminal
velocity.

###   Effects of Damage

When a character is damaged to 0 hit points or lower they are normally
unconscious. When a character is damaged past their negative Durability they
are normally dead (i.e. if a target had a 4 Durability is is damaged to -5 HP
or lower, they are dead). Certain powers may modify these levels.

When a Vehicle or Automaton (Robot) is damaged to 0 hit points or lower they
are made inoperable and lose functionality. When the Vehicle or Automaton is
damaged past it's maximum hitpoints it is utterly annhilated (i.e. if a Robot
with 24 maximum hit points is damaged to -25HP or lower it is annhilated,
simple repair won't work it'll need to be rebuilt from scratch).

###   Grapple Rules

An attacker can attempt to grapple a single opponent effectively grabbing them
and holding them in place. With a single action first roll to hit the target,
if successful now roll an opposed strength check d20 + Attackers Effective
Strength vs. Targets Effective Strength + 11. Vehicles that dont have strength
can be locked down as well. Effective strength for personal jet packs is 10,
effective strength for standard cars is 14, and effective strength for a tank
is 20. If the roll succeeds the object or being is grappled and has their
evade reduced to the minimum of 11, in addition they may only make restricted
movements giving them a 10 modifier to attacks/skill checks. The grapple
continues until the target successfully breaks free (they can attempt to break
free once per action without the 10 penalty), the grappler must use all their
actions to hold the grapple. After the grapple has been successfully applied
the grappler may squeeze the target once per round for double their strength
in damage.

###   Example of combat

Lets say a gunner with AGI 8 and Missile 6 is firing from a turret ( unlike
hull mounted weapons no upper bounds on accuracy ) with 4 Heavy .50 calibur
machine guns at an enemy ship. The gunners total bonus to hit is +16 (14+2 for
rapid fire). His target is a an enemy ship with vehicle agility 7 (so its max
evade is 11+7=18) with a pilot who has AGI 8 and Pilot Starship 6,
overshadowing the max ship's defense at 11+7 = 18 evade. Lets say the gunner
rolls a 20 and then on the additional d20 roll gets another 20 (no additional
rolls are gained after the initial critical). His total to hit score is 16+40
= 56. Since the gunner scored great than or equal to 25 a hit has been scored.
In fact the score (56-25=30)/2 successes or 15 successes. The maximum damage
that a Heavy .50 calibur machine gun can inflict is 2*Base of 14 = 28. If 14
successes or more are achieved on the attack roll, then the maximum damage
capacity of the Heavy .50 calibur machine gun is reached (any additional
successes wouldnt add anything). The enemy ship is a Cruiser with 16 DR. Since
there are 4 Heavy .50 calibur machine gun in this battery the gunner rolls a
d6 for each Heavy .50 calibur machine gun or 4d6 to see how many of the rapid
fire shots hit and gets a 12. The damage the Cruiser takes is 28-16 = 12
damage per shot so the total damage from the battery is 144. Since this
Cruiser only has 60HP it has been sunk. Now if the target was a fortified
10foot steel wall with greater DR (28 DR) the Heavy .50 calibur machine gun
couldn't normally pierce its defense (the maximum damage capacity of 2*14=28
is less than or equal to 28 total DR). But when a critical hit is scored at
least 1 point is done per weapon so only four damage (the number of Heavy Rifles in
a battery) would have been done. This damage can still add up but doesn't put
the steel wall in immediate jeoporady.

###   Computer Combat

Handle computer combat as follows. Base Initiative is the d6 + THT (the melee
mastery QuickDraw and the missile mastery Quick Shot dont apply to computer
combat). The characters thought is used for initiative, and acts as agility in
that it determines number of attacks and the to hit roll. The will of the
hacker acts as both strength and durability in cyberspace (which acts as the
damage of his attacks and provides damage resistance (WIL/3 rounded down) and
hit points). In hacking combat the number of hit points a hacker has is equal to
their (1 + comp ops skill level/2 (rnd down)) * WIL. The hackers computer
skill adds to his offensive rolls and raise his hacking evade.

The To HIT roll is:

THT + Comp Systems + d20

Evade in computer attacks is:

THT + Comp Systems + 11

Damage for each attack is:

Base Damage + # Successes - DRtarget

To develop a security system, give it a thought and a will and skill level.
For instance, a prestigious bank might have a security system with 10 thought
and will along with 10 Computer Systems skill. Treat the thought as agility
for number of attacks and attack rolls and will as strength and durability. If the
security system is defeated (reduced to zero hacking hit points) the hacker
has broken in and may make changes to the system (successful computer skill
checks with difficulty equal to computers thought + 11 to avoid system
users/the A.I. noticing the changes). If the hacker is defeated (his hacking
hit points have been reduced to zero) he has failed to penetrate the system
defenses and he has been identified as trying to break in the system, his
system entry point has also been identified. Good banks will have systems with
stats and skill of 10 or 12. Military systems tend to have stats and skills of
14+.

###   Combat Movement

A target can move its normal jog move (agility) in yards/second. Sprinting
(1.5x normal movement) can only be done for 5xDUR in seconds; jogging can be
done for 5XDUR in minutes (although the running skill can extend this time).
Walking speed is half agility and can be maintained indefinitely. During
comat, a character can move at his normal movement speed at the cost of one
action (either walking, jogging or sprinting).

Movement occurs in initiative order unless the initiative winner forces his
opponents to move first (usually a good idea unless your racing for a doorway
etc.) and occurs before attacks.

###   optional hit locations

Hit Location Table

Roll a d6: Roll Area Hit Special Penalty 1 Left Leg. -2 to evade 2 Right Leg
-2 to evade 3 Left Arm -2 to hit 4 Right Arm -2 to hit 5 Torso

6 Head +1 to damage

#   Equipment

Often times Masterwork quality equipment isn't available (connections can be
used to make them automatically available to an investigator team for a
session), but if they are the cost is 100 times the base price. General
masterwork armor gives +2DR, masterwork shields give +1 deflection, and
masterwork weapons give a +2 bonus to hit and overall these items look really
freaking sweet. Vehicles generally have a HP rating. When a vehicle is reduced
to zero hitpoints it is no longer functional. When HP are reduced past the
negative starting HP of a vehicle it is completely annhilated.

##   Miscellaneous

##   Weapons Rules

Crafting all types of weapons takes Mechanical Engineering. In addition
amunition and bombs require Chemistry. Laser technology and nuclear devices
require Electrical Engineering.

Shot Gun: Slug: Damage: 8, Spray: 6 Damage to a cone that's one tenth it's
range (max 60ft).

  * Sub-Machine Guns: Damage similar to pistols, about 1lb heavier, and although they may be fired full auto, they give a penalty of -2 to hit when doing so unless two hands are used to hold and brace the weapon.
  * Rifles: are +2 damage & cost for weapon is x2 & range x5, and many allow automatic fire
  * Heavy rifles: are +4 damage & cost x4 & range x20, allow automatic fire, or are sniper based +2 to hit and include a range finder scope.
  * Cannons: (artillery or vehicle based) are +10 damage) cost x100 & range x40, certain amunition may have a splash radius see grenades (default is armor piercing round).

Construction time for Rifles and Heavy rifles is equal to pistol construction
time. Cannons require 2X the time, and are +4 difficulty. Tech Level is either
Standard(S), Laser Technology(L), Ultra-Rare Government Issue(U).

##   Vehicles

Vehicles have a maximum evasion capability based on their design. The max
evade is equal to 11 + vehicle agility. So for a vehicle with a 8-vehicle
agility, the best evade possible is an 11 + 8 = 19, and the best attack bonus
with any hull mounted weapons is +8. So a driver with a 4 agility and 2 pilot
land skill would have a 11 + 6 or 17 evade and wouldnt reach the vehicle
limit, but a driver with a 8 agility and 4 pilot land, would only have a 19
evade (the limit) even though his potential is 11 + 8 + 4 = 23. Unless
otherwise noted the maximum vehicle agility is 2 times their listed base or
starting vehicle agility (most vehicles have a base vehicle agility of 8 with
a max vehicle agility of 16). Note that each level of shields lowers the
agility by 1, but doesn't affect the maximum agility possible.

Tank: vehicle agility: 6. Single Cannon depending on tank type (some may even
have missiles) and a heavy rifle usually of the same type, which is attached
to the top for anti-personnel. Both weapons are aimed internally by one pilot
and 2 gunners, but a single pilot may also man both guns. Max Speed is 3
yards/sec per vehicle agility point.

#   Occult/Magic Section

##   Spell Mastery

Occultists can, if they so choose, opt to become masters at certain skills. It
is possible to become far better at a certain spell than the regular caster,
given a sufficient amount of practice. Spell mastery costs the level of the
spell + 5 in XP, and adds 5 to the effective level of the caster when casting
that spell. So, a mage choosing to specialize in Wrack must pay 9XP; a mage
choosing to master in Levitation must pay 9XP and in either case would cast
those spells at their normal skill level + 5 (to determine damage, duration,
etc.).

##   Spell System

Characters with the Mystic gift have obtained enough knowledge to be dangerous
in the area of magic and the occult. You have a number of power points equal
to your Thought stat + the sum of all your Occult Lore Skill Levels. For a
level 3 Occultist with a THT of 7 your total power points is 13 = 7 + 1 + 2 +
3. Th Occultist begins with 2 level one spells, then they must acquire any
additional spells in game (scrolls, ancient texts, good motivator). A spell or
ritual may only be learned if the Mystic has a Occult Lore skill greater than
or equal to the spell level. Each spell or ritual requires one power point per
level of the ability to use or activate. These power points may be used on the
following spells and rituals:

LEVEL 1

  * Force Bolt: The Mystic raise one of his palms or may shout a powerful telekinetic blast capable of tearing apart objects and targets. Use as missile attack, damage is 6+1/caster level.
  * Sense Supernatural: The Mystic can sense any supernatural occurance, or object within a 50 yard radius sphere centered on him. Duration: 5 rds / lvl. note: this power is blocked by most thick solid objects.
  * Mystical Illumination: creates a sphere of light with the power of about a 100 watt light bulb, color of light specified controlled by caster. duration: 10 min / lvl. note: light follows the mystic remaining within 1 yard of him, but may be dimmed at will.

LEVEL 2

  * Decipher Script: By activating this power any writings or ancient glyphs may be understood by the caster. The ritual requires 10 seconds to perform and often time requires light directly reflected from the sun (sometimes with great golden dishes held by foreign boys named Aziz). The effect is permanent for the Mystic.
  * Insight: The Mystic is granted glimpses of the immediate past of a specific person or place. The Mystic can see back into time a maximum of 1 day per Occult Lore level. The effect is immediate, but the casting requires a short ritual lasting 10 seconds.

LEVEL 3

  * Close Wounds: Mystic can heal 1d6+1 hp of 1 target's wounds per casting. range: 10 yards
  * Summon Stupidity: Conjure forth the basist insticts of a creature by temporarily lowering their thought by 4 points. Duration 10 minutes. Make a contest of d20 + Occult Lore vs. Targets Will + 11.
  * Lesser Mystic Armor: Creates a minor invisible field about the caster granting 3 Armor DR. Duration 1hour/level.

LEVEL 4

  * Wrack: The curse of pain is the Mystic's armor piercing offensive power. This ability allows the Mystic to attack a target that he has line of sight to and is within range (100yards) with a writhing pain greater than any bowel wrenching horror created by overspicing Thai food. The visible effects of this spell are described by the caster and may vary for each casting, although they is always a tell tale visible or auditory sign. The base damage for the attack is 6 + 1 per level of Occult Lore Skill Level and it's a mental based attack (armor is ignored, DR is determined by WIL alone). A missile roll to hit is required and used to calculate additional damage as normal up to 2 times the base. Casting and effect take place with the use of a single combat action.
  * Levitation: One of the more obvious powers of the Mystic is the ability to hover. Simply by concentrating he may hover in any direction at his normal movement, even the equivalent speed of jogging or sprinting for short periods of time (see movement for times). The duration after activating this ability is 10 minutes per Occult Lore level.

LEVEL 5

  * Exorcism: This spell allows a mystic to dispel and banish spirits from the physical plane of existence. Duration: Permanent. Powerful spirits may require a skill test to dispel, Occult Lore Skill vs. their WIL.
  * Jade Eye Mind Trick: Confuse a target into believing whatever you say for a short time. They should be extraordinarily gullable if affected. Make a contest of d20 + Occult Lore vs. Targets Will + 11. Duration target is affected is 2 rounds + 1 round per success (each 2 over target number).

LEVEL 6

  * Mystic Armor: Creates a powerful invisible field about the caster granting 6 Armor DR. Duration 1hour/level.
  * Blessed Weapon: Temporarily enchants a weapon to have +2 to hit and base damage (ranged weapons provide this bonus to any ammunition they fire). In addition this weapon strikes as silver and holy (lycanthropes and vampire's can't self heal this damage). Duration 1hour.

LEVEL 7

  * Flight: A superior version of levitation, now by concentrating the caster may hover in any direction at his double his normal movement, even the equivalent speed of jogging or sprinting for short periods of time (see movement for times). The duration after activating this ability is 10 minutes per Occult Lore level.

LEVEL 8

  * Greater Mystic Shroud: Creates an even more powerful invisible field about the caster granting 8 Armor DR (the equivelant of Masterwork full body armor). Duration 1hour/level.

LEVEL 9

  * Invincible Flesh: This powerful spell requires the caster to sacrifice d6 hit points, in exchange the target of this spell (can be the caster) gains 4STR and 6DUR and additional +2 Skin DR. Duration 1 minute/level. Range 30feet.

LEVEL 10

  * Summon Force: A barely visible spirit like force is summoned by performing this ritual which takes 10 seconds to perform. The force is completely controlled by the mystic which can puppet it's actions within his line of sight. Treat the force as an independent body that can be controlled by the Mystic and has the following stats and abilities: Str:12, Agi:casters Tht, Dur:12, Tht:NA acts on casters initiative,Wil:NA,Pre:NA although it might scare people. The force has the following gifts: Grit lvl 3, Thick Skin, and Sustained, and has a base Armor of 6 (Total DR 12= 4Dur+2Skin+6Armor). In addition it has all the skills of the summoner (as he's puppeting it). Each action of the caster may be his own or he may use the force. The duration of the force is 10 minutes per Occult Lore level.
  * Corporeal Reformation: This mighty spell can best be described by the ritual performed in Conan the Barbarian by the sorceror. As the spirits of the damned come to reclaim the tatoo covered deceased target the caster focuses all their power into bringing them back from the dead. It takes an entire night to cast this ritual. This ritual may be performed with only a small fraction of the original dead body. A new body is created, but may be heavily scarred.
